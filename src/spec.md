# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a comprehensive interior design project management application with user authentication, project management, shopping lists, budget tracking, task management, client CRM, logistics tracking, moodboards, and client portal access.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement user authentication with three roles (admin, manager, designer) supporting registration, login, and role-based access control
- Create project management system with client data, timeline, budget, documentation, and room-based organization
- Build shopping list module with manual entry, reusable product library, and comprehensive product details (name, image URL, price, shop, link, availability, quantity, category, status)
- Implement automatic budget calculation system with real-time totals for entire project, per-room breakdown, and per-category breakdown (furniture, lighting, finishing materials, appliances, decorations) with budget overage warnings
- Create task management system with deadlines, status tracking, and notes
- Build client CRM module with contact database, contact history, notes, and project associations
- Implement logistics tracking system with five product statuses: planned, ordered, in transit, delivered, installed
- Create moodboard module where inspiration boards link to actual shopping list products showing real budget impact
- Implement client portal with read-only access to shared project elements (visualizations, moodboards, product lists, budget) with commenting capability
- Build frontend interfaces for all modules: project dashboard, shopping list, room management, budget overview, task management, client portal, moodboards, logistics tracking, client management, product library, authentication pages, and project list
- Design minimalist, professional visual theme with neutral colors, clean typography, and responsive layout for desktop and mobile

**User-visible outcome:** Users can register and log in with role-based access, create and manage interior design projects with comprehensive client data and timelines, organize projects by rooms, build shopping lists with detailed product information, track budgets automatically across projects/rooms/categories with overage warnings, manage tasks with deadlines, maintain client relationships in CRM, track product logistics through five-stage pipeline, create moodboards linked to real products showing budget impact, and share selected project elements with clients for approval and commenting through a dedicated client portal. All functionality is accessible through a clean, professional, responsive web interface.
