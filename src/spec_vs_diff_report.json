  "summary": "The implementation addresses all four requirements with comprehensive changes to fix the infinite loading state. The frontend adds timeout detection, error handling components, and improved loading state logic. The backend appears to include getCallerUserProfile implementation. The hook properly tracks both actor and query loading states. However, without seeing the complete backend implementation details, some aspects of REQ-3 cannot be fully verified.",

      "description": "Added comprehensive error handling UI component (ProfileLoadingError.tsx) with styled alerts, retry button, and login options",
      "reason": "While REQ-4 requires error handling and user feedback, the detailed UI implementation with specific styling, icons (AlertCircle, RefreshCw), and multi-option error recovery goes beyond the stated requirement for 'clear error message' and 'options to retry'",

      "description": "Enhanced LoginButton component with error recovery logic for 'User is already authenticated' error",
      "reason": "The LoginButton now includes specific error handling for authentication state conflicts that was not mentioned in any requirement. This appears to be defensive programming added beyond the scope",
